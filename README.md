## Project Structure

The project is divided into several main directories:

```bash
    portfolio-website/
    │
    ├── public/                     # Static files like the main HTML, icons, and images
    │   └── index.html              # The root HTML file where React will mount the app
    │
    ├── src/                        # Source code for the React application
    │   ├── fonts/                  # Font files used in the application
    │   ├── components/             # Reusable React components
    │   ├── App.js                  # Main React component, often used for routing logic
    │   ├── index.js                # Entry point for React (where the app is rendered to the DOM)
    │   ├── index.css               # Main CSS file for global styles
    │   └── styles/                 # Custom styles for the application
    │
    ├── .gitignore                  # List of files and directories that Git should ignore
    ├── package.json                # Lists project dependencies, scripts, and metadata
    ├── package-lock.json           # Automatically generated, locks the dependency versions
    └── README.md                   # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Steps:

1. **Download the ZIP File:**
If you purchased the code, download the project ZIP file from the provided link or from your purchase confirmation.

2. **Extract the ZIP File:**
Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your desired directory on your computer.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
After extracting the files, navigate to the project folder in your terminal:
```bash
    cd path/to/extracted-folder
```

Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:
```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:
```bash
    npm start
```
The website should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Customizing Your Portfolio
- Once the development server is running, you can begin modifying the website to suit your personal branding.
- All major sections of the site (e.g., About, Projects, Contact) can be customized in the `src/components` directory.
- If you want to modify the colors or the fonts, the root variables are defined in the `src/index.css` file.
